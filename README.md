# CALLS

Computational Assistant for Language Learning Systems

CALLS is a system of python and bash scripts that take input webpage text (e.g. A simple English Wikipedia page), process this text and output language learning problems in the Openwords markup language (OWML). CALLS will take input from the user on the kinds of language concepts that are desired in outputed language learning problems.

The OWML represents language learning problems in a simple text format, and is read by the Openwords webapp. Alternatively, OWML problems could be transfered to other problem expression formats.
